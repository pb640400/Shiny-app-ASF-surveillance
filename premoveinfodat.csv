Scenario number,A scenario label string,"Days prior to movement when sampling is performed. If there are multiple days enter them seperated by a comma e.g., 1,2. Note if entering multiple days also enter sample size for multiple days.","This is the sample size required for individual pig testing. If there are multiple days of testing enter them seperated by a comma e.g., 30,30",This indicates whether individual pig sample should be taken from same pens as rope samples (true or false),The days prior to movement when oral fluid samples are taken,"The percent of pens from which rope samples are taken (e.g., 33)",Indicates whether to take rope samples from the same pens as was performed on previous sampling day.,"The prioritization scheme for blood (individual pig) surveillance.  1 is dead, sick, live sampling  type  2 is sick, dead, live sampling.  3 is dead then live sampling. type 4 is dead only. Type 5 is for dead  sick version of idals. Sample type 6  is for sick and non sick live. Sample type 7 is random live pigs.","The pen prioritization scheme for placing ropes. 1 is random pen sampling. 2 is sick pig prioritization. 3 is dead pig prioritization, type 4 is dead then sick pig prioritization.",Days on which to apply mortality trigger,Absolute daily mortality threshold for 1000 pigs,If this is true then mortality trigger will be applied on all days from day indicated in mortalitytrigdays prior to the movement day. If not it will be applied on specific days.,Whether dead pig tissue samples are stored for sampling,Maximum number of dead pigs sampled under stored sampling protocols,Number of days preceding movement to accumulate tissues for dead pig sampling in storage
